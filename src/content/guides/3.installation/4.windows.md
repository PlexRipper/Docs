# Installation on Windows

### Installing Docker Desktop

You can skip this step if you already have Docker Desktop installed on your Windows machine.

To install Docker Desktop on Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the Docker Desktop download page for Windows at: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

2. Click on the "Download for Windows" button to start the download. Make sure to download the stable version suitable for your Windows operating system.

3. Once the download is complete, locate the Docker Desktop installer file (typically named `Docker Desktop Installer.exe`) in your downloads folder or the designated location.

4. Double-click on the installer file to launch the Docker Desktop installation wizard.

5. The installation wizard will guide you through the setup process.

6. Choose the installation options according to your preference. By default, all options are selected, including "Install required Windows components for WSL 2."

7. During the installation, you might be prompted to enable Hyper-V and Virtual Machine Platform features if they are not already enabled on your system. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable these features.

8. Once the installation is complete, you may be prompted to sign in to Docker Hub or create a Docker ID. You can choose to sign in or skip this step.

9. Docker Desktop will start automatically after the installation is finished. You should see the Docker Desktop icon in the system tray (lower-right corner of the screen).

10. Docker Desktop will take a few moments to initialize and start the Docker daemon. Once it's ready, the Docker Desktop icon in the system tray will indicate that Docker is running.

11. You can right-click on the Docker Desktop icon in the system tray to access various Docker features and options.

12. To verify that Docker is installed and running correctly, open a command prompt or PowerShell window and run the following command: `docker version`. It should display the version information of Docker CLI and Docker Server.

That's it! Docker Desktop is now installed and ready to use on your Windows machine. You can start using Docker commands to manage containers and images, and run Dockerized applications.
