### Installing Docker Desktop

You can skip this step if you already have Docker Desktop installed on your Mac machine.

To install Docker Desktop on Mac, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Docker website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

2. Click on the "Get Docker Desktop for Mac" button. This will start the download of the Docker Desktop installer.

3. Once the download is complete, open the Docker.dmg file. It should be located in your Downloads folder.

4. Drag and drop the Docker.app icon into the Applications folder to install Docker Desktop.

5. Open the Applications folder and double-click on the Docker.app icon to launch Docker Desktop for the first time.

6. You'll see a prompt asking for permission to install the Docker Desktop components. Enter your macOS password and click "OK".

7. Docker Desktop will start the installation process. It may take a few minutes to complete.

8. After the installation is finished, you'll see the Docker icon in your menu bar. It looks like a whale. Click on the Docker icon to open the Docker menu.

9. From the Docker menu, select "Preferences" to customize Docker Desktop settings.

10. In the Preferences window, you can adjust various settings such as the number of CPUs and amount of memory allocated to Docker containers. You can also configure network settings and enable/disable features like automatic updates.

11. Once you've configured your preferences, close the Preferences window.

12. Docker Desktop is now installed and running on your Mac. You can verify it by opening a terminal and running the following command:

```
docker version
```

If Docker is properly installed, you should see the version information printed in the terminal.

        - `/Config`: this is where PlexRipper will store its configuration, logs and database
