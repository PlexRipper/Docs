# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I help?

## How can I show my appreciation?

The rising number of GitHub stars, docker pulls and users going out of their way to make bug reports and give feedback
is already the biggest honor for me.

## Is PlexRipper detectable by Plex server owners?

Yes and no. Yes in the sense that they can always cross-reference the IP connecting to the server which is using a lot
of bandwidth with a PlexAccount that has access to their server.

No, in the sense that programs such as Tautalli, etc. will not trigger.

Take this with a grain of salt, as this might change at any moment and please make an issue if you are aware of some
vulnerability in PlexRipper.

## Will Plex ban my account for the use of PlexRipper?

Most likely not, but I do not own them, so I can't give guarantees. If you want to be extra safe then make a dummy
account, and then use that account to request access to various Plex servers. Your real account will then never be
exposed to a Plex server its downloading from.

## How is PlexRipper spelled?

Ah yes, the main question in life. Even I, as its almighty creator, am not too sure but in my infinite, most likely
misspelling, wisdom have settled on "PlexRipper". Even though the capital R in a single word doesn't make too much
sense.

## What is the difference between PlexRipper stable and dev?

The dev branch contains all the latest under development changes.

## Which browsers are supported by PlexRipper?

Officially, all chromium based browsers such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
and [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium).

Brave works as well, just disable the Brave shields functionality on PlexRipper. See
this [issue](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/19037#issuecomment-1287769602).

It "should" however work with all browsers, except ancient ones like Internet
Explorer and trash ones like Safari. Don't expect support for either of those.

## Is this project dead? Why no updates? Can you hurry up?

Check the [homepage](/) for what is currently happening.

## I'm impressed with you work, can I hire you?

Yes, I ([JasonLandbridge](https://github.com/JasonLandbridge)) work as a freelance Vue.js/.NET developer, and I'm
always looking forward to the next awesome project. But if you're secretly hoping for more updates on PlexRipper, then
you might not want to hire me ;)
